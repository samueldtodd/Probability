# Probability
Probability puzzles and challenges simulated in Python. All code can be run in the terminal.

## Dice Roll

You're offered the following bet: two dice will be rolled simultaneously, if neither die show a 5 or 6 you win. If either die shows 5 or 6, you lose. Should you take the bet? This Python script uses object-orientate programming to produce a die class with a method to simulate the rolling of dice. The user is first asked whether they would take the bet and then asked to input the number of simulations they wish to run. The game is then run for the desired number of simulations and the proportion of games in which the user won is returned. Different messages are printed based on whether or not the user took the bet. The user then has the option to view a mathematical explanation of calculating the probability of winning. While loops and try/exception are utilised to ensure user input is appropriate.
